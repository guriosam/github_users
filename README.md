You need to edit two classes before run it.

1. utils.Config class

  Change the following information to your own:

  1.1 Username

  1.2 Password

 2. utils.LocalPaths

  2.1 PATH
    Change this one to where you want to save the data.

    *WARNING*

    You have to put the buggy_users.csv in this path.

  2.2 CURL
  
      If you're a LINUX/MAC USER, just change it to "curl".
      If you're a WINDOWS USER, put your CURL directory in the path.
